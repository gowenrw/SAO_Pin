# SAO_Pin

Welcome to the SAO_Pin website.

The SAO_Pin is a simple adapter that will allow you to wear any badge Shitty Add On (SAO) as a broach pin instead of being attached to a badge or a totem.

The PCB is small at 25mm x 40mm, just large enough to hold its few components and hopefully small enough to be hidden behind any attached SAO.

The Gerber files have been made available [HERE](https://github.com/gowenrw/SAO_Pin/raw/refs/heads/master/eda/SAO_Pin/gerber/2025-06-03.zip) for anyone to use to order thier own PCBs.

Simply download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/gowenrw/SAO_Pin/raw/refs/heads/master/eda/SAO_Pin/gerber/2025-06-03.zip) and then choose your PCB manufacture to upload it to for ordering.

The design is simple, requiring only five components:

* SAO 2x3 keyed socket header, the type used on badges not the type used on SAO's.
  * ![SAO_Badge_Header_thumb.jpg](./images/SAO_Badge_Header_thumb.jpg)
* CR2032 Battery Holder with THT pins
  * ![CR2032_Holder_THT_thumb.jpg](./images/CR2032_Holder_THT_thumb.jpg)
* 20mm Brooch clip pin clasp with M2 sized screw holes for attachment
  * ![Brooch_Pin_2cm_thumb.jpg](./images/Brooch_Pin_2cm_thumb.jpg)
* M2 screws for attaching the pin.
  * ![M2_Screw_thumb.jpg](./images/M2_Screw_thumb.jpg)
* M2 nuts for attaching the pin.
